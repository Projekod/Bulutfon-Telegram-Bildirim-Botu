A Telegram Bot based on the official [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)


### Introduction
This is a pure php Telegram Bot, fully extensible via plugins.
Telegram recently announced official support for a [Bot
API](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution) allowing integrators of
all sorts to bring automated interactions to the mobile platform. This
Bot aims to provide a platform where one could simply write a plugin
and have interactions in a matter of minutes.
The Bot can:
- retrive update with webhook and getUpdate methods.
- supports all types and methods according to Telegram API (20 January 2016).
- supports supergroups.
- handle commands in chat with other bots.
- manage Channel from the bot admin interface 
- Full support for **inline bots** (**new!**)
- Messages, InlineQuery and ChosenInlineQuery are stored in the Database (**new!**)

## Instructions
### Create your first bot

1. Message @botfather https://telegram.me/botfather with the following
text: `/newbot`
   If you don't know how to message by username, click the search
field on your Telegram app and type `@botfather`, you should be able
to initiate a conversation. Be careful not to send it to the wrong
contact, because some users has similar usernames to `botfather`.

2. @botfather replies with `Alright, a new bot. How are we going to
call it? Please choose a name for your bot.`

3. Type whatever name you want for your bot.

4. @botfather replies with `Good. Now let's choose a username for your
bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or
tetris_bot.`

5. Type whatever username you want for your bot, minimum 5 characters,
and must end with `bot`. For example: `telesample_bot`

6. @botfather replies with:

    Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at
telegram.me/telesample_bot. You can now add a description, about
section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of
commands.

    Use this token to access the HTTP API:
    <b>123456789:AAG90e14-0f8-40183D-18491dDE</b>

    For a description of the Bot API, see this page:
https://core.telegram.org/bots/api

9. @botfather replies with `Choose a bot to change group messages settings.`

10. Type `@telesample_bot` (change to the username you set at step 5
above, but start it with `@`)

11. @botfather replies with

    'Enable' - your bot will only receive messages that either start
with the '/' symbol or mention the bot by username.
    'Disable' - your bot will receive all messages that people send to groups.
    Current status is: ENABLED

12. Type `Disable` to let your bot receive all messages sent to a
group. This step is up to you actually.

### Require this package with Composer
Install this package through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
Edit your project's `composer.json` file to require
`longman/telegram-bot`.

Create *composer.json* file:
```js
{
    "name": "yourproject/yourproject",
    "type": "project",
    "require": {
        "php": ">=5.5.0",
        "longman/telegram-bot": "*"
    }
}
```
And run composer update

**Or** run a command in your command line:

```
composer require longman/telegram-bot
```

### Choose how to retrieve Telegram updates
The bot can handle updates with **webhook** or **getUpdate** method:

|      | Webhook | getUpdate |
| ---- | :----: | :----: |
| Description | Telegram send the update directy to your host | You have to fetch Telegram updates |
| Host with https | Required | Not required |
| Mysql | Not required | Required  |

## Webhook installation
You need server with https and composer support.
You must set a [WebHook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook).
Create *set.php* (just copy and edit *examples/set.php*) and put into it:
```php
<?php
//Composer Loader
$loader = require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$API_KEY = 'your_bot_api_key';
$BOT_NAME = 'namebot';
$link = 'https://yourdomain/yourpath_to_hook.php';
try {
    // create Telegram API object
    $telegram = new Longman\TelegramBot\Telegram($API_KEY, $BOT_NAME);
    // set webhook
    $result = $telegram->setWebHook($link);
    if ($result->isOk()) {
        echo $result->getDescription();
    }
} catch (Longman\TelegramBot\Exception\TelegramException $e) {
    echo $e;
}
```

And open your *set.php* via browser.

After, create *hook.php* (or just copy and edit *examples/hook.php*) and put:
```php
<?php
$loader = require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$API_KEY = 'your_bot_api_key';
$BOT_NAME = 'namebot';

try {
    // create Telegram API object
    $telegram = new Longman\TelegramBot\Telegram($API_KEY, $BOT_NAME);

    // handle telegram webhook request
    $telegram->handle();
} catch (Longman\TelegramBot\Exception\TelegramException $e) {
    // log telegram errors
    // echo $e;
}
```

###Self Signed Certificate
To upload the certificate, add the certificate path as param in *set.php*:
```php
$result = $telegram->setWebHook($url, $certificate_path);
```

## getUpdate installation
You need the database Mysql active.

Create *getUpdateCLI.php* (just copy and edit *examples/getUpdateCLI.php*) and put into it:
```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php
$loader = require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$API_KEY = 'your_bot_api_key';
$BOT_NAME = 'namebot';
$credentials = array('host'=>'localhost', 'user'=>'dbuser', 'password'=>'dbpass', 'database'=>'dbname');

try {
    // create Telegram API object
    $telegram = new Longman\TelegramBot\Telegram($API_KEY, $BOT_NAME);
    $telegram->enableMySQL($credentials);
    // handle telegram getUpdate request
    $telegram->handleGetUpdates();
} catch (Longman\TelegramBot\Exception\TelegramException $e) {
    // log telegram errors
     echo $e;
}
```

give to the file the permission for execution:
```
chmod 775 getUpdateCLI.php
```
then run
```
./getUpdateCLI.php
```
### Types
All types implemented according to Telegram API (20 January 2016).

#### Inline Query
Full support for inline query according to Telegram API (20 January 2016).

### Methods
All methods implemented according to Telegram API (20 January 2016).

####Send Message
Message longer than 4096 characters are splitted in more messages.

```php
$result = Request::sendMessage(['chat_id' => $chat_id, 'text' => 'Your utf8 text ðŸ˜œ ...']);
```

####Send Photo
To send a local photo provide the file path as second param:

```php
$data['chat_id'] = $chat_id;
$result = Request::sendPhoto($data,$this->telegram->getUploadPath().'/'.'image.jpg');
```

If you know the file_id of a previously uploaded file, just provide it in the fist param:

```php
$data['chat_id'] = $chat_id;
$data['photo'] = $file_id;
$result = Request::sendPhoto($data);
```

*sendAudio*, *sendDocument*, *sendSticker*, *sendVideo* and *sendVoice* works in the same way.
See *ImageCommand.php* for a full example.
####Send Chat Action

```php
Request::sendChatAction(['chat_id' => $chat_id, 'action' => 'typing']);
```
####getUserProfilePhoto
Retrieve the user photo, see the *WhoamiCommand.php* for a full example.

####GetFile and dowloadFile
Get the file path and download it, see the *WhoamiCommand.php* for a full example.

#### Send message to all active chats
To do this you have to enable the Mysql connection.
Here's an example of use:

```php
$results = $telegram->sendToActiveChats(
        'sendMessage', //callback function to execute (see Request.php methods)
        array('text'=>'Hey! Checkout the new feature!!'), //Param to evaluate the request
        true, //Send to chats (group chat)
        true, //Send to users (single chat)
        null, //'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss' date range from
        null  //'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss' date range to
    );
```
You can also broadcast message to users, from the private chat with your bot. Take a look at the admin interace below. 
## Utilis
### MySQL storage (Recomended)
If you want insert in database messages/users/chats for further usage
in commands, create database and import *structure.sql* and enable
Mysql support after object creation and BEFORE handle method:

```php
$credentials = ['host'=>'localhost', 'user'=>'dbuser',
'password'=>'dbpass', 'database'=>'dbname'];

$telegram->enableMySQL($credentials);
```
You can set a custom prefix to all the tables while you are enabling Mysql:

```php
$telegram->enableMySQL($credentials, $BOT_NAME.'_');
```
Consider to use the *utf8mb4* branch if you find some special characters problems.
You can also store inline query and chosen inline query in the database.
### Channels Support 
All methods implemented can be used to manage channels.  
With admin interface you can manage your channel directly with your bot private chat.

### Commands
The bot is able to recognise commands in chat with multiple bot (/command@mybot ).
It can execute command triggering a chat event. Here's the list:

- New chat participant (**NewchatparticipantCommand.php**)
- Left chat participant (**LeftchatparticipantCommand.php**)
- New chat title (**NewchattitleCommand.php**)
- Delete chat photo (**DeletechatphotoCommand.php**)
- Group chat created (**GroupchatcreatedCommand.php**)
- Super group chat created (**SupergroupchatcreatedCommand.php**)
- Channel chat created (**ChannelchatcreatedCommand.php**)
- Inline query (**InlinequeryCommand.php**)
- Chosen inline result (**ChoseninlineresultCommand.php**)


**GenericCommand.php** let you handle commands that don't exist or to
use commands as a variable:
Favourite colour? **/black, /red**
Favourite number? **/1, /134**

**GenericmessageCommand.php** let you handle any type of message.

Maybe you would like to develop your own commands. A good practice is
to store them outside *vendor/*. This can be done adding the method:

```php
$COMMANDS_FOLDER = __DIR__.'/Commands/';
$telegram->addCommandsPath($COMMANDS_FOLDER);
```

Inside *examples/Commands/* there are some sample that show how to use types.

#### Commands Configuration
With this method you can set some command specified parameters, for
example, google geocode/timezone api key for date command:
```php
$telegram->setCommandConfig('date', ['google_api_key' => 'your_google_api_key_here']);
```

### Admin Commands
Enabling this feature, the admin bot can perform some super user command like:
- Send message to all chats */sendtoall*
- List all the chats started with the bot */chats*
- Send a message to a channel */sendtochannel* (NEW! see below how to configure it)
You can specify one or more admin with this option:

```php
$telegram->enableAdmins(['your_telegram_user_id','Othersid']);
```
Telegram user id can be retrieved with the command **/whoami**.
Admin commands are stored in *src/Admin/* folder.
To know all the commands avaiable type **/help**.

#### Channel Administration 
To enable this feature follow those steps: 
- Add your bot as channel administrator, this can be done with any telegram client.
- Enable admin interface for your user as explained in the admin section above.
- Enter your channel name as a param for the sendtoall command:
```php
    $telegram->setCommandConfig('sendtochannel', ['your_channel'=>'@type_here_your_channel']);
```
- Enjoy!

### Upload and Download directory path
You can overwrite the default Upload and Download directory with:
```php
$telegram->setDownloadPath("yourpath/Download");
$telegram->setUploadPath("yourpath../Upload");
```
###Unset Webhook
Edit *example/unset.php* with your credential and execute it.  

### Logging
Thrown Exception are stored in *TelegramException.log* file (in the base directory).

Incoming update (json string from webhook and getUpdates) can be logged on a text file, set those options with the methods:
```php
$telegram->setLogRequests(true);
$telegram->setLogPath($BOT_NAME.'.log');
```

Set verbosity to 3, to log also curl requests and responses from the bot to Telegram:

```php
$telegram->setLogRequests(true);
$telegram->setLogPath($BOT_NAME.'.log');
$telegram->setLogVerbosity(3);
```
